# Weather Widget Project

This is a simple weather widget built with React. It allows users to input a city name and get real-time weather data, including temperature, humidity, and more. The app displays the current weather condition using dynamic background images and icons based on the weather (e.g., sunny, rainy, cold).

## Features
- **Real-time weather data**: The app fetches weather data from OpenWeather API.
- **Dynamic background**: The background changes based on the weather condition, displaying appropriate GIFs or images for sunny, rainy, or cold weather.
- **Temperature, Humidity, and More**: Users can view current temperature, humidity, minimum/maximum temperatures, and a description of the weather condition.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to work on both desktop and mobile screens.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **OpenWeather API**: To fetch real-time weather data based on city name.
- **Material-UI**: For designing UI components like buttons, text fields, and cards.
- **Vite**: A build tool that provides fast bundling and development server for React projects.
- **CSS/SCSS**: For styling the application.

## Setup (Vite + React)

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
